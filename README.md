=====================

To Fix:
-- default go full-screen
-- Cluster distance — optimize/clean code; fix short-size problem w/Skateboards

-- gravity slider values are weird
-- gravity code works in weird ways, needs fixing



TO FIX (LATER)
- dataCrystalsApp::scaleValues() not working
- Scaling problems — work on code in scaleValues()
- Setting colors in datum should be moved to dataCrystalsApp class, less storage more optimized
- Cursor doesn't display properly when not full-scrren, which is annoyihg
