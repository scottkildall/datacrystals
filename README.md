=====================

To Fix:
-- Cursor doesn't display, which is annoyihg

-- Cluster distance — need a pct calculation, right now is hard-coded to 10.0
	--> (make a keyboard shortcut)

-- Colors in datum should be moved to dataCrystalsApp class

-- setSize() is untested

-- gravity slider values are weird

-- gravity code works in weird ways, needs fixing



TO FIX (LATER)
- dataCrystalsApp::scaleValues() not working
- Scaling problems — work on code in scaleValues()
